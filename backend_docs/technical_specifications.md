# DoD Fitness App Backend Service - Enhanced Technical Specifications

## Programming Language and Framework

- Language: TypeScript
- Framework: NestJS
  - Rationale: NestJS provides a robust, scalable architecture with built-in support for TypeScript, dependency injection, and modular development.

## Database

- Primary Database: PostgreSQL
  - Rationale: PostgreSQL offers robust ACID compliance, excellent performance, and advanced features like JSON support.
- Caching Layer: Redis
  - Rationale: Redis provides high-performance caching to reduce database load and improve response times.
- Time-Series Database: InfluxDB
  - Rationale: For efficient storage and querying of time-series data from wearable devices and fitness trackers.

## ORM

- TypeORM
  - Rationale: TypeORM integrates well with TypeScript and NestJS, providing type-safe database operations.

## API

- RESTful API following OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification
- GraphQL API for flexible data querying and reduced over-fetching
- WebSocket support for real-time updates and notifications

## Authentication and Authorization

- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for authorization
- OAuth2 for third-party integrations (e.g., wearable devices)

## External Services Integration

- OpenAI GPT API for generating personalized workout and nutrition plans
- Integration framework: Axios for HTTP requests
- Message Queue: RabbitMQ for asynchronous processing and event-driven architecture

## AI and Machine Learning

- TensorFlow.js for client-side ML inference
- Python with scikit-learn and TensorFlow for server-side ML model training
- MLflow for ML model lifecycle management

## Geospatial Data

- PostGIS extension for PostgreSQL to handle geospatial data
- Mapbox API for mapping and location services

## Real-time Communication

- Socket.io for real-time bidirectional event-based communication

## Natural Language Processing

- Rasa for building conversational AI chatbots

## Testing

- Unit Testing: Jest
- E2E Testing: Supertest
- API Testing: Postman/Newman
- Load Testing: k6

## Code Quality and Style

- ESLint for code linting
- Prettier for code formatting
- Husky for pre-commit hooks

## Documentation

- API Documentation: Swagger UI (integrated with NestJS)
- Code Documentation: TypeDoc

## Monitoring and Logging

- Logging: Winston
- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana
- Distributed Tracing: Jaeger

## Containerization and Orchestration

- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration and scaling

## CI/CD

- GitLab CI/CD for automated testing, building, and deployment

## Security

- Helmet.js for HTTP header security
- bcrypt for password hashing
- HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- OAuth2 for secure third-party integrations

## Performance Optimization

- Compression: Use compression middleware for response compression
- Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Caching: Multi-level caching strategy (application, database, CDN)

## Scalability

- Horizontal scaling through Kubernetes
- Database read replicas for scaling read operations
- Microservices architecture for independent scaling of components

## Version Control

- Git with GitFlow branching model

## Package Management

- npm for package management

## Environment Management

- dotenv for environment variable management

## File Storage

- Amazon S3 or equivalent for storing user-uploaded files (e.g., profile pictures)

## Backup and Disaster Recovery

- Regular automated backups of the database
- Multi-region deployment for high availability and disaster recovery
