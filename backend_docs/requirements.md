# DoD Fitness App Backend Service - Requirements

## Functional Requirements

1. User Management
   - Implement user registration and authentication
   - Support JWT-based authentication
   - Manage user profiles with military-specific information

2. Workout Plan Management
   - Generate personalized workout plans based on user goals and military branch
   - Store and retrieve workout plans
   - Allow users to update workout progress and provide feedback

3. Nutrition Plan Management
   - Create customized nutrition plans considering user goals and dietary restrictions
   - Store and retrieve nutrition plans
   - Enable users to log meals and track nutritional intake

4. Progress Tracking
   - Record and store user fitness data over time
   - Calculate and update user progress towards fitness goals
   - Generate progress reports and visualizations

5. Data Analysis
   - Analyze user data to provide insights and recommendations
   - Generate aggregate reports on fitness trends (for authorized personnel)

6. External Service Integration
   - Integrate with LLM or other AI services for plan generation and personalization
   - Support integration with wearable fitness devices (future feature)

7. API Endpoints
   - Implement RESTful API endpoints as defined in the OpenAPI specification
   - Ensure all endpoints are properly secured and follow best practices

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. Performance
   - API response times should be under 200ms for 95% of requests
   - Support concurrent users (initial target: 10,000 simultaneous users)

2. Scalability
   - Design the system to be horizontally scalable
   - Implement caching mechanisms to reduce database load

3. Security
   - Encrypt all sensitive data in transit and at rest
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Adhere to DoD security standards and guidelines
   - Regularly update and patch all system components

4. Availability
   - Achieve 99.9% uptime (excluding scheduled maintenance)
   - Implement fault tolerance and disaster recovery mechanisms

5. Data Integrity
   - Ensure ACID compliance for database transactions
   - Implement data validation and sanitization for all inputs

6. Compliance
   - Adhere to relevant military data protection regulations
   - Implement audit logging for all critical operations

7. Maintainability
   - Follow clean code principles and best practices
   - Provide comprehensive documentation for all components
   - Implement monitoring and logging for easier troubleshooting

8. Testability
   - Achieve at least 80% code coverage with unit tests
   - Implement integration tests for all critical paths
   - Set up automated testing pipelines

9. Interoperability
   - Design API to be version-compatible
   - Support standard data formats (JSON) for easy integration with other systems

10. Localization
    - Support multiple languages (initially English, with capability to add more)
    - Handle different time zones for deployed personnel

These requirements provide a comprehensive foundation for developing a robust, secure, and scalable backend service for the DoD Fitness App. They should be reviewed and updated regularly as the project evolves.
